      MISSION <br /><span style="color: coral">For 34 YEARS </span>
    </h1>
    <p class="mission-paragraph full-width">
      …David Dorfman Dance has created movement that seeks to de-stigmatize
      the notion of accessibility and interaction in post-modern dance by
      <br />
      embracing audiences with visceral, meaningful dance, music and text. By
      sustaining a vision to create innovative, inclusive, <br />
      movement-based performance that is radically humanistic, DDD maintains a
      core commitment to examine and unearth issues and ideas that enliven,
      incite, and <br />
      excite audiences in dialogue and debate about social change and a myriad
      of other topics. In advocating his mission “to get the whole world
      <br />
      dancing,” Dorfman’s work has enjoyed broad and diverse audiences
      nationally and internationally. DDD has performed extensively throughout
      North and South America, Great Britain, Europe, and Central Asia. DDD
      has regularly performed in <br />
      New York City at major venues including The Brooklyn Academy of Music
      (BAM), The Joyce Theater, The Kitchen, Danspace Project/St. Mark’s
      <br />
      Church, La Mama Theater, The Duke on 42nd Street, The Met Breuer, and
      the 92nd St. “Y”/Harkness Dance Festival. David Dorfman, <br />
      the company’s dancers, and DDD’s artistic collaborators have also been
      honored with eight New York Dance and Performance (Bessie) Awards.
